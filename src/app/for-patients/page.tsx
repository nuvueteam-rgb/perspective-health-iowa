    question: "How do I become a new patient at Perspective Health?",
    answer:
      "Getting started is easy! Simply use our contact form or call our office to schedule your new patient appointment. We'll gather some basic information, answer your initial questions, and get you set up with one of our providers.",
  },
  {
    question: "What should I bring to my first appointment?",
    answer:
      "Please bring: a photo ID, your insurance card, a list of current medications and supplements (with dosages), any recent lab work or medical records you have access to, and a list of your current symptoms, concerns, and health goals. The more information you can share upfront, the more productive your first visit will be.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long is the initial appointment?",
    answer:
      "Initial appointments are typically 60–90 minutes. We invest this time in a thorough review of your health history, symptoms, goals, and concerns. Follow-up appointments are generally 30–45 minutes.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer telehealth appointments?",
    answer:
      "Yes, we offer telehealth appointments for established patients for appropriate visit types. Please contact our office to determine if your needs can be addressed via telehealth.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I access my medical records?",
    answer:
      "You can request your medical records by contacting our office. We comply with all HIPAA regulations regarding medical records requests and aim to fulfill requests within 30 business days.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I refill my prescriptions?",
    answer:
      "Prescription refill requests should be submitted through your patient portal or by calling our office during business hours. Please allow 2–3 business days for refill processing. Controlled substances require an in-person visit.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is your cancellation policy?",
    answer:
      "We ask that you provide at least 24 hours' notice to cancel or reschedule an appointment. Late cancellations or no-shows may be subject to a fee. We understand that unexpected situations arise — please contact us as soon as possible if you need to reschedule.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I get my lab results?",
    answer:
      "Lab results are reviewed by your provider and communicated through the patient portal or by phone, depending on the nature of the results. Routine results are typically available within 5–7 business days. Abnormal or time-sensitive results will be communicated sooner.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you treat children?",
    answer:
      "Our current practice focuses on adult patients (18+). We'd be happy to help connect you with appropriate pediatric resources in the area.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use Perspective Health alongside my current doctors?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely — and we encourage it. We believe in collaborative care and are happy to work alongside your existing healthcare team, coordinate care, and share records as appropriate and with your consent.",
